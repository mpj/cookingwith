A mobile app that allows a user to vote on a time-limited poll. After voting, one has to wait for a period of time before allowed to vote again. To circumvent this, the user can pay for votes using in-app purchases.

As an admin of a show, I want to
  * create a poll with a specified start and end date.
  * remove poll options
  * be disallowed to create polls overlapping eachother in time


As a user, I want to
  * add options on an open poll.
  * vote on items on an open poll.
  * be disallowed to vote on open polls.
  * be disallowed to vote when I have no votes
  * gain new votes after a period of time
  * buy new votes immideately
  * see a countdown to when I receive new votes
  * see a countdown to when the poll ends
  * request to be notified when new there is a new poll
  * request to be be notified when I get new votes
  * request to be notified when a show is released for a poll I've voted on
  * Turn off notifications for the above
  * list shows in order of release date
  * watch shows in the youtube app by tapping on them



Architecture
  viewmodels
    - extremely thin logic layer, almost just configuration. Little to no unit tests.
  facade
    fake  - not real at all, just to prototype vm logic
    hack - real, but throwaway implementation.
    stable - re-write of hack for things that haven't changed so much in a while.
    mock  - for unit testing vm
  services
    more complicated things that grew out of being a function in the facade.
