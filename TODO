A mobile app that allows a user to vote on a time-limited poll. After voting, one has to wait for a period of time before allowed to vote again. To circumvent this, the user can pay for votes using in-app purchases.


* Absolutely Critical for MVP

As an admin of a show, I want to
  * change TITLE!
  * change start date
  * create a poll with a specified start and end date.
  * remove poll options
  * be disallowed to create polls overlapping eachother in time

As a user, I want to
  * see when a poll starts
  * automatically go to the current open poll with a uri
  * see list in order of ... end date?

Bugs
  * flashing vote button
  * Security. :)

Empty?
  Write down critical improvements that are needed for the MVP broken into 1-hour fixes.

Episodes
(listing these separate as they are kind of semi-MVP)
* list episodes in order of release date
  * watch episodes in the youtube app by tapping on them

Notifications
  * request to be notified when new there is a new poll
  * request to be be notified when I get new votes
  * request to be notified when a show is released for a poll I've voted on
  * Turn off notifications for the above



* After MVP is up



Architecture
  viewmodels
    - extremely thin logic layer, almost just configuration. Little to no unit tests.
  facade
    fake  - not real at all, just to prototype vm logic
    hack - real, but throwaway implementation.
    stable - re-write of hack for things that haven't changed so much in a while.
    mock  - for unit testing vm
  services
    more complicated things that grew out of being a function in the facade.
